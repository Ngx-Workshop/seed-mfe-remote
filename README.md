## Overview

**seed-mfe-remote** is the ‚Äúhello world‚Äù of Ngx-Workshop micro-frontends ‚Äì start here to build your own feature module in a modular, scalable way.

A starter repository for building a new **micro-frontend (MFE)** remote in the Ngx Workshop ecosystem. It provides a minimal Angular project (generated with Angular CLI) already configured for Webpack Module Federation, allowing it to plug into the Ngx-Workshop **shell** application.

The purpose of this seed is to give developers a quick starting point to create a focused MFE, with examples of configuration, deployment, and integration into the platform.

# Getting Started (Local Development)

To get the MFE running locally on your machine for development:

\
**1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.**

```bash
# If you didn't run the quickstart script, clone the repo manually:
git clone https://github.com/Ngx-Workshop/seed-mfe-remote.git
cd seed-mfe-remote
npm install

#else
cd ~/NGX-WORKSHOP-ORG/seed-mfe-remote
```

\
**2. Start the local dev server for the MFE.** \
Run the seed‚Äôs special development script:

```bash
npm run dev:bundle
```

This will build the MFE and serve the static bundle on port **4201**. The application‚Äôs files (including `remoteEntry.js`) will be available at `http://localhost:4201/`.

> [!TIP]
>
> Why not just ng serve? <br><sub>In this micro-frontend architecture, we need to serve the static bundle (transcompiled files) because the shell application dynamically loads the MFE‚Äôs `remoteEntry.js` at runtime. <br> <br> So, when we save the MFE code, we need to rebuild the bundle for the shell to pick up changes. Using the `http-server` package to serve the built files simulates how the MFE would be hosted in a real deployment.</sub>

\
**3. Use the MFE Orchestrator to integrate with the shell.**

Running the entire platform (shell + all MFEs + backend) locally is unrealistic.

Instead, you can run this one MFE locally and connect it to the live shell running in beta using the Ngx-Workshop's [MFE Orchestrator Admin UI](https://admin.ngx-workshop.io/list-mfe-remotes). The Orchestrator allows you to override the remote‚Äôs URL so that _your_ shell session loads the local code.

You will see a list of all registered MFEs in the platform, including this seed MFE.                                                               | ![List of MFE Remotes](https://github.com/Ngx-Workshop/.github/blob/main/readme-assets/list-registered-mfe.png?raw=true)                                     |
| **Enable Dev Mode for the MFE:** click the Dev Mode toggle button next to your MFE‚Äôs entry (it looks like a code < > icon). This will open the Dev Mode Options panel for that MFE.                                             | ![Enabling Dev Mode for an MFE in the Orchestrator UI](https://github.com/Ngx-Workshop/.github/blob/main/readme-assets/enabling-dev-mode.png?raw=true)       |
| In the **Dev Mode Options** dialog, toggle the switch to **‚ÄúTurn on Dev Mode.‚Äù** Then, in the Remote Entry Point field, enter the URL to your locally served remoteEntry.js.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add `<h1>Hello World</h1>` text to the MFE‚Äôs [list component template](https://github.com/Ngx-Workshop/seed-mfe-remote/blob/main/src/app/components/example-mongodb-doc-list.component.ts#L43) <br><br> Open the main application; https://beta.ngx-workshop.io/seed-mfe | ![MFE seed live in the shel](https://github.com/Ngx-Workshop/.github/blob/main/readme-assets/seed-mfe-hello-world.png?raw=true) |

The shell should now fetch your local MFE‚Äôs code instead of the deployed version. You can develop your MFE in real time(you have to manually reload), while the rest of the app (other MFEs and services) comes from the cloud.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **How does the Dev Mode override work?** <br> <sub>Under the hood, the shell application checks the browser‚Äôs `localStorage` for any dev-mode flags when it loads. Enabling Dev Mode in the Orchestrator writes a special key (mapping your MFE name to the localhost URL) into localStorage on your browser. The shell reads this and substitutes the remote‚Äôs URL accordingly. This means only your browser session uses the local build; all other users continue to use the normal remote URL. It‚Äôs a handy way to develop against the live system without affecting others.</sub>

# Creating a New MFE from This Seed

Once you‚Äôve explored the seed project, you can use it to scaffold a brand new micro-frontend. Follow these steps to create your own MFE based on seed-mfe-remote:

\
**1. Clone the seed repository and rename it.**
Decide on a name for your new MFE (for example, `mfe-user-journey-example`). Then clone this repo to a new folder with that name:

Prerequisites:\
<sub>The script requires GitHub CLI to be installed and authenticated:</sub>

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

\
Bash Script: https://github.com/Ngx-Workshop/.github/blob/main/profile/create-mfe-remote.sh

```bash
# 1) Create and enter your workspace folder
mkdir -p ~/NGX-WORKSHOP-ORG && cd ~/NGX-WORKSHOP-ORG

# 2) Download the installer script from the org profile
curl -fsSL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngx-Workshop/.github/main/profile/create-mfe-remote.sh \
  -o create-mfe-remote.sh

# (Alternatively)
# wget -qO create-mfe-remote.sh \
#   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ngx-Workshop/.github/main/profile/create-mfe-remote.sh

# 3) Make it executable and run it
chmod +x ./create-mfe-remote.sh
./create-mfe-remote.sh
```

\
**2. Register the new MFE in the Orchestrator.**

Now that your MFE is deployed, inform the shell about it by registering it through the [MFE Orchestrator Admin UI](https://admin.ngx-workshop.io/list-mfe-remotes). In the admin interface, add a new MFE entry (or update an existing one if you repurposed the seed entry) with:

| **Name:** the name of your MFE (e.g. mfe-user-journey-example). This name will be used as route within the shell. Shell app will proform slugification (lowercase, hyphenated) automatically. <br><br> **Remote Entry URL:** the URL where the shell can load the remote‚Äôs bundle. By convention, remote bundles are hosted under the `/remotes/<repo-name>/remoteEntry.js` path. For the beta environment, the URL would be: <br><br> `https://beta.ngx-workshop.io/remotes/mfe-user-journey-example/remoteEntry.js` <br><br> <sub>(Replace mfe-user-journey-example with your actual MFE name. Ensure this matches the folder/name configured on the server.)</sub> | ![MFE seed live in the shel](https://github.com/Ngx-Workshop/.github/blob/main/readme-assets/admin-mfe-create.png?raw=true) |

Save the new MFE entry. The shell application will now be aware of your micro-frontend.

> ![NOTE]
>
> Each user-journey MFE in Ngx-Workshop is mounted under a route derived from its name (which is typically in snake-case format). The shell auto-generates the route based on the MFE name you registered. For example, if your MFE is named `mfe-user-journey-example`, you can navigate to `/mfe-user-journey-example` on the main site, and the shell will load your MFE‚Äôs remote module. (The mfe-shell container automatically maps this route even if no navigation link is yet present in the UI.) This means you can directly visit the URL to see your MFE in action as soon as it‚Äôs registered and deployed.

# Best Practices

When developing your micro-frontend, keep these best practices in mind to ensure consistency and maintainability within the Ngx Workshop ecosystem:

- **Focus Each MFE on a Single Feature:** MFEs (especially user-journey MFEs) should remain small and modular, encapsulating one feature or user flow. Avoid creating ‚Äúmonolithic‚Äù remotes that try to do too much. Smaller MFEs load faster and can be developed and deployed independently by different teams.

- **Avoid Nested Micro-Frontends:** Do not have one remote MFE attempt to directly load another remote. The shell container is responsible for orchestrating which MFEs are loaded on a page. Each MFE should be independent; nested MFEs (one remote importing another remote) can lead to complexity and are not supported in this architecture. If you find yourself needing this, consider if those parts should actually be in the same MFE or exposed via a shared library.

- **Embrace Reactive Programming:** Use idiomatic Angular patterns with RxJS for state management and UI composition within your MFE. For example, use services with Observable streams to handle data flow, and use the async pipe in templates for automatically updating UI on data changes. Embracing a reactive approach makes it easier to integrate with the shell and other MFEs, since data can flow in a stream-like manner and side effects are minimized. It also keeps your MFE‚Äôs internal logic decoupled, which is ideal in a micro-frontend environment.

- **Keep Shared Dependencies in Sync:** Because MFEs in Ngx-Workshop might share libraries (via Module Federation‚Äôs shared modules), try to use the same version of common packages (Angular itself, RxJS, etc.) as the shell and other MFEs to avoid version conflicts. The seed is configured with peer dependencies that match the shell ‚Äì it‚Äôs best to update in tandem with the platform when those dependencies change.

By following these guidelines, your new micro-frontend will remain efficient, maintainable, and compatible with the rest of the Ngx-Workshop platform. Happy coding, and welcome to the Ngx-Workshop micro-frontend journey!
